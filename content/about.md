Hey there, I’m TheFizzyFish, a security analyst with over 5 years of hands-on experience in the wild world of cybersecurity. From diving deep into the chaos of security breaches to navigating the ever-shifting landscape of threats, I’ve seen it all and I’m still hungry for more.

When I'm not diving head first into logs or hunting down vulnerabilities, I'm all about developing my skillset. I play CTF challenges to test my skills and keep sharp and I'll be posting writeups once active boxes are retired. Learning isn't just a passion; it’s my way of life and I'd like to give back to the community any way that I can.

Outside the digital realm, you'll find me hitting the pavement with distance running, chasing down new trails with my dog, or sinking into a binge-watching session to decompress.

Got something to share or just want to chat? Hit me up through discord at thefizzyfish. Thanks for checking out my space!

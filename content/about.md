Hey there, I’m TheFizzyFish, a security rebel with over 5 years of hands-on experience in the wild world of cybersecurity. From diving deep into the chaos of security breaches to navigating the ever-shifting landscape of threats, I’ve seen it all and I’m still hungry for more.

When I'm not cracking codes or hunting down vulnerabilities, I'm all about pushing my limits. I dive into Hack The Box challenges to test my skills and keep sharp. Learning isn't just a passion; it’s my way of life.

Outside the digital realm, you'll find me hitting the pavement with distance running, chasing down new trails with my dog, or sinking into a binge-watching session to decompress. These are my ways of staying grounded and energized.

Got something to share or just want to chat? Hit me up through discord at thefizzyfish. Thanks for checking out my space!
